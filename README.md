# Machine Learning, Statistical Learning & Artificial Intelligence

2021-2022

[MSc Data Science for Economics, University of
Milan](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en)

*Overview*

**Statistical Learning** is part of the [Machine Learning, Statistical
Learning, Deep Learning & Artificial
Intelligence](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2022/machine-learning-statistical-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence)
course.  
The course introduces students to the most important algorithmical and
statistical machine learning tools. The first part of the course focuses
on the statistical foundations and on the methodological aspects. The
second part is more hands-on, with laboratories to help students develop
their software skills.

The **Statistical Learning** part of the course aims at teaching a
methodological and practical overview to statistical learning methods.
The emphasis is on the applications and state-of-the-art techniques are
presented through hands-on labs with **R**.
